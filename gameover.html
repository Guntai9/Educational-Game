      Sherlock has awoken from his coma. After hearing about your interrogation techniques and questioning methods, he has concluded they were useless. 
      None of the questions you asked were relevant to the case. With no previous experience as a detective you failed to interrogate the suspects properly. 
      Why would a dog be a suspect? And how could a 7 year old child commit such a homocide.
